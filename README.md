- This is my first project written in C++
Pacman Game - project
- For those of you not familiar with Pacman, it's a game where Pacman (the yellow circle with a mouth in the above figure) moves around in a maze and tries to eat as many food pellets as possible, while avoiding the ghosts . If Pacman eats all the food in a maze, it wins.

# SFML PATH
After downloading SFML, ensure that its path is set to: "C:/SFML/SFML-2.5.1".

# Start Playing
Once SFML is downloaded and placed in the correct path, run the code without any errors to start playing.

# Programming:
Implement the game using C++, CMakeLists, and SFML.
